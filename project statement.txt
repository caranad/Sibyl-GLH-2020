One challenge that many businesses are facing during the COVID-19 pandemic deals with re-negotiating the terms of their contracts with their partners. With so many businesses on the line due to the limits of the pandemic, they now face the challenge of making sure that their contracts are reasonable within the limits of their monthly financial dues. Furthermore, the strain of negotation will be worsened by the lack of available information at their disposal - which can heavily impact the decision process.

Our application, Negotiation Buddy, aims to solve the problem through the use of voice technology to help business owners transcribe their negotation conversations, and in the process, give suggestions to help them make the best decision on whether or not to proceed with the contract, or not. Through Negotiation Buddy, we give business owners the power to beat the pandemic, and save their business through the information at the tip of their fingers.
